1. Highlighted the rows that had "United States" as the state for demarcation purposes. 
   Data may be incorrect but the numerical statistics might still be useful

Note : disregard pt 1, it'd be biased, nevertheless a copy of the ones where US is not deleted is saved in DHV

ADDENDUM to above pt: The US part IS required, however, proceed with caution, the holes in the data seem to appear 
			    in the United States Demographics values

2 options:-

A. I make a {Just US} file, treat the {WITH US} dataset and the former separately, 
   infer things (Requires MAJOR changes in {Just US})

B. I use the original file directly (Requires MAJOR changes in the ENTIRE dataset)

----------------------------------------- From this point on I'm working with the {WITH US} File -----------------------------------------

2. Sorted the data by ascending order of years (1999 - 2015)

3. Race and Hispanic Origin - needed or not? (Yes because there really are no other categories in the W/O US File). Hid it and the "Sex" & "Age" columns

4. To do: Evaluate the necessity of the death rate statistics

5. Washington vs District of Columbia confusion cleared

5. Made a new attribute : Total yearly deaths
