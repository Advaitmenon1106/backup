Problem Statement / Question :-
In the Forbes 2000 list, what are the changes undergone by companies between 2019 (pre pandemic)
and 2020 (pandemic era)
Note 1 : only companies common to both the 2019 and 2020 listed in 2020 on the Forbes 2000
list are being compared, so the row length does not sum up to 2000 

Note 2: The source (CSV) file is standardised (to billions of USD) before utiling the same for the code.
